 * A MouseEvent object is dispatched into the event flow whenever mouse events occur.
 * A mouse event is usually generated by a user input device, such as a mouse or a trackball,
 * that uses a pointer.
 *
 *   <p class="- topic/p ">When nested nodes are involved, mouse events target the deepest possible nested node that
 * is visible in the display list. This node is called the <i class="+ topic/ph hi-d/i ">target node</i>. To have a
 * target node's ancestor receive notification of a mouse event, use
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">EventDispatcher.addEventListener()</codeph> on the ancestor node with the
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">type</codeph> parameter set to the specific mouse event you want to detect.</p>
 *
 *   EXAMPLE:
 *
 *   The following example uses the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">MouseEventExample</codeph> and
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">ChildSprite</codeph> classes to show how mouse events are dispatched using a simple image.
 * This example carries out the following tasks:
 * <ol class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li ">The example declares properties for the size (100 x 100 pixels) and the background color
 * (orange) for later use in drawing the square.</li><li class="- topic/li ">The constructor creates a new ChildSprite object <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">child</codeph>. Its constructor first
 * draws an orange 100 x 100 pixel square at coordinates (0,0) by calling its <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">draw()</codeph>
 * method and then adds seven event listeners/subscribers.
 * <ul class="- topic/ul "><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">click</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">clickHandler()</codeph>: Dispatched when the user single-clicks with the left mouse button
 * over the square.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">doubleClick</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">doubleClickHandler()</codeph>: Dispatched when the user double-clicks the left mouse button
 * over the square.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseDown</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseDownHandler()</codeph>: When the ChildSprite
 * object (the orange square) is clicked, a <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">trace()</codeph> message is printed to the screen, and then
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">ChildSprite.draw()</codeph> is called, which draws a dark yellow square in place
 * of the light blue one drawn in <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseOverHandler()</codeph>.  The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseDownHandler()</codeph> method also adds a
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseMove</codeph>event listener and the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseMoveHandler()</codeph> subscriber (described below),
 * which processes the mouse moves.  Then the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">startDrag()</codeph> method is called, which
 * allows the Sprite object to be dragged.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseOut</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseOutHandler()</codeph>: Dispatched whenever the pointer leaves the
 * square area.  The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">draw()</codeph> method is called to return the square to its normal
 * size and color.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseOver</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseOverHandler()</codeph>: Dispatched when the mouse pointer is over the square.
 * This method redraws the square so that it is larger and its background color is dark yellow.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseUp</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseUpHandler()</codeph>: When the user releases the mouse button, the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseMove</codeph>
 * event listener is removed and <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">stopDrag</codeph> is called, which freezes the square in place.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseMove</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseMoveHandler()</codeph>: Called as part of the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseDownHandler()</codeph> function, and dispatched when the user is pressing the left mouse button and dragging the square.</li><li class="- topic/li "><codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseWheel</codeph>/<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">mouseWheelHandler()</codeph>: Dispatched when the user rotates the mouse
