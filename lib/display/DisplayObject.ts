	/**
	 * A value from the BlendMode class that specifies which blend mode to use.
	 * A bitmap can be drawn internally in two ways. If you have a blend mode enabled or an
	 * external clipping mask, the bitmap is drawn by adding a bitmap-filled square shape to the vector
	 * render. If you attempt to set this property to an invalid value, Flash runtimes set the value
	 * to BlendMode.NORMAL.
	 *
	 *   The blendMode property affects each pixel of the displayobject.
	 * Each pixel is composed of three constituent
	 * colors (red, green, and blue), and each constituent color has a value between 0x00 and 0xFF.
	 * Flash Player or Adobe AIR compares each constituent color of one pixel in the movie clip with
	 * the corresponding color of the pixel in the background. For example, if blendMode
	 * is set to BlendMode.LIGHTEN, Flash Player or Adobe AIR compares the red value of the displayobject with
	 * the red value of the background, and uses the lighter of the two as the
	 * value for the red component of the displayed color.The following table describes the blendMode settings.
	 * The BlendMode class defines string values you can use.
	 * The illustrations in the table show blendMode values applied to a circular
	 * displayobject (2) superimposed on another displayobject (1).BlendMode ConstantIllustrationDescriptionBlendMode.NORMALThe displayobject appears in front of the background. Pixel values of the displayobject
	 * override those of the background. Where the displayobject is transparent, the background is
	 * visible.BlendMode.LAYERForces the creation of a transparency group for the displayobject. This means that the display
	 * any is pre-composed in a temporary buffer before it is processed further. This is done
	 * automatically if the displayobject is pre-cached using bitmap caching or if the displayobject is
	 * a displayobject container with at least one child any with a blendMode
	 * setting other than BlendMode.NORMAL. Not supported under GPU rendering.
	 * BlendMode.MULTIPLYMultiplies the values of the displayobject constituent colors by the colors of the background color,
	 * and then normalizes by dividing by 0xFF,
	 * resulting in darker colors. This setting is commonly used for shadows and depth effects.
	 *
	 *   For example, if a constituent color (such as red) of one pixel in the displayobject and the
	 * corresponding color of the pixel in the background both have the value 0x88, the multiplied
	 * result is 0x4840. Dividing by 0xFF yields a value of 0x48 for that constituent color,
	 * which is a darker shade than the color of the displayobject or the color of the background.BlendMode.SCREENMultiplies the complement (inverse) of the displayobject color by the complement of the background
	 * color, resulting in a bleaching effect. This setting is commonly used for highlights or to remove black
	 * areas of the displayobject.BlendMode.LIGHTENSelects the lighter of the constituent colors of the displayobject and the color of the background (the
	 * colors with the larger values). This setting is commonly used for superimposing type.
	 *
	 *   For example, if the displayobject has a pixel with an RGB value of 0xFFCC33, and the background
	 * pixel has an RGB value of 0xDDF800, the resulting RGB value for the displayed pixel is
	 * 0xFFF833 (because 0xFF > 0xDD, 0xCC < 0xF8, and 0x33 > 0x00 = 33). Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.DARKENSelects the darker of the constituent colors of the displayobject and the colors of the
	 * background (the colors with the smaller values). This setting is commonly used for superimposing type.
	 *
	 *   For example, if the displayobject has a pixel with an RGB value of 0xFFCC33, and the background
	 * pixel has an RGB value of 0xDDF800, the resulting RGB value for the displayed pixel is
	 * 0xDDCC00 (because 0xFF > 0xDD, 0xCC < 0xF8, and 0x33 > 0x00 = 33). Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.DIFFERENCECompares the constituent colors of the displayobject with the colors of its background, and subtracts
	 * the darker of the values of the two constituent colors from the lighter value. This setting is commonly
	 * used for more vibrant colors.
	 *
	 *   For example, if the displayobject has a pixel with an RGB value of 0xFFCC33, and the background
	 * pixel has an RGB value of 0xDDF800, the resulting RGB value for the displayed pixel is
	 * 0x222C33 (because 0xFF - 0xDD = 0x22, 0xF8 - 0xCC = 0x2C, and 0x33 - 0x00 = 0x33).BlendMode.ADDAdds the values of the constituent colors of the displayobject to the colors of its background, applying a
	 * ceiling of 0xFF. This setting is commonly used for animating a lightening dissolve between
	 * two anys.
	 *
	 *   For example, if the displayobject has a pixel with an RGB value of 0xAAA633, and the background
	 * pixel has an RGB value of 0xDD2200, the resulting RGB value for the displayed pixel is
	 * 0xFFC833 (because 0xAA + 0xDD > 0xFF, 0xA6 + 0x22 = 0xC8, and 0x33 + 0x00 = 0x33).BlendMode.SUBTRACTSubtracts the values of the constituent colors in the displayobject from the values of the
	 * background color, applying a floor of 0. This setting is commonly used for animating a
	 * darkening dissolve between two anys.
	 *
	 *   For example, if the displayobject has a pixel with an RGB value of 0xAA2233, and the background
	 * pixel has an RGB value of 0xDDA600, the resulting RGB value for the displayed pixel is
	 * 0x338400 (because 0xDD - 0xAA = 0x33, 0xA6 - 0x22 = 0x84, and 0x00 - 0x33 < 0x00).BlendMode.INVERTInverts the background.BlendMode.ALPHAApplies the alpha value of each pixel of the displayobject to the background.
	 * This requires the blendMode setting of the parent displayobject to be set to
	 * BlendMode.LAYER.
	 * For example, in the illustration, the parent displayobject, which is a white background,
	 * has blendMode = BlendMode.LAYER. Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.ERASEErases the background based on the alpha value of the displayobject. This requires the
	 * blendMode of the parent displayobject to be set to
	 * BlendMode.LAYER. For example, in the
	 * illustration, the parent displayobject, which is a white background, has
	 * blendMode = BlendMode.LAYER. Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.OVERLAYAdjusts the color of each pixel based on the darkness of the background.
	 * If the background is lighter than 50% gray, the displayobject and background colors are
	 * screened, which results in a lighter color. If the background is darker than 50% gray,
	 * the colors are multiplied, which results in a darker color.
	 * This setting is commonly used for shading effects. Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.HARDLIGHTAdjusts the color of each pixel based on the darkness of the displayobject.
	 * If the displayobject is lighter than 50% gray, the displayobject and background colors are
	 * screened, which results in a lighter color. If the displayobject is darker than 50% gray,
	 * the colors are multiplied, which results in a darker color.
	 * This setting is commonly used for shading effects. Not supported under GPU rendering.BlendMode.SHADERN/AAdjusts the color using a custom shader routine. The shader that is used is specified

	/**
	 * An indexed [] that contains each filter any currently associated with the displayobject.
	 * The flash.filters package contains several classes that define specific filters you can
	 * use.
	 *
	 *   Filters can be applied in Flash Professional at design time, or at run time by using
	 * ActionScript code. To apply a filter by using ActionScript, you must make a temporary copy of the
	 * entire filters [], modify the temporary [], then assign the value
	 * of the temporary [] back to the filters []. You cannot directly
	 * add a new filter any to the filters [].To add a filter by using ActionScript, perform the following steps (assume that the
	 * target displayobject is named myDisplayObject):Create a new filter any by using the constructor method of your chosen filter
	 * class.Assign the value of the myDisplayObject.filters [] to a temporary [], such
	 * as one named myFilters.Add the new filter any to the myFilters temporary [].Assign the value of the temporary [] to the myDisplayObject.filters [].If the filters [] is undefined, you do not need to use a temporary [].
	 * Instead, you can directly assign an [] literal that contains one or more filter anys that
	 * you create. The first example in the Examples section adds a drop shadow filter by using
	 * code that handles both defined and undefined filters []s.To modify an existing filter any,
	 * you must use the technique of modifying a copy of the filters []:Assign the value of the filters [] to a temporary [], such as one
	 * named myFilters.Modify the property by using the temporary [], myFilters. For example,
	 * to set the quality property of the first filter in the [], you could use the
	 * following code: myFilters[0].quality = 1;Assign the value of the temporary [] to the filters [].At load time, if a displayobject has an associated filter, it is marked to cache itself as a
	 * transparent bitmap. From this point forward, as long as the displayobject has a valid filter list,
	 * the player caches the displayobject as a bitmap. This source bitmap is used as a source
	 * image for the filter effects. Each displayobject usually has two bitmaps: one with the
	 * original unfiltered source displayobject and another for the final image after filtering.
	 * The final image is used when rendering. As long as the displayobject does not
	 * change, the final image does not need updating.The flash.filters package includes classes for filters. For example, to create a DropShadow
	 * filter, you would write:
	 * <codeblock>
	 *
	 *   import flash.filters.DropShadowFilter
	 * var myFilter:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter (distance, angle, color, alpha, blurX, blurY, quality, inner, knockout)
	 *
	 *   </codeblock>
	 * You can use the is operator to determine the type of filter assigned to
	 * each index position in the filter []. For example, the following code shows
	 * how to determine the position of the first filter in the filters [] that
	 * is a DropShadowFilter:
	 *
	 *   <codeblock>
	 *
	 *   import flash.text.TextField;
	 * import flash.filters.~~;
	 * var tf:TextField = new TextField();
	 * var filter1:DropShadowFilter = new DropShadowFilter();
	 * var filter2:GradientGlowFilter = new GradientGlowFilter();
	 * tf.filters = [filter1, filter2];
	 *
	 *   tf.text = "DropShadow index: " + filterPosition(tf, DropShadowFilter).tostring(); // 0
	 * addChild(tf)
	 *
	 *    filterPosition(DisplayObject:DisplayObject, filterClass:Class):int {
		 * for (var i:uint = 0; i < DisplayObject.filters.length; i++) {
		 * if (DisplayObject.filters[i] is filterClass) {
		 * return i;
		 * }
		 * }
		 * return -1;
		 * }
	 *
	 *   </codeblock>
	 * Note: Since you cannot directly add a new filter any to the
	 * DisplayObject.filters [], the following code has no
	 * effect on the target displayobject, named myDisplayObject:
	 * <codeblock>
	 *
	 *   myDisplayObject.filters.push(myDropShadow);
