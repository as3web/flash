	 * No input color correction is applied; only the stage output is mapped to the main

	 * accurate proofing and more efficient cross-media output. Be aware, though, that color management does not provide

	 * Nor does color management eliminate the need for custom or edited profiles.
	 * Color profiles are dependent on browsers, operating systems (OS), OS extensions, output devices, and application support.Applying color correction degrades the Flash runtime performance.
	 * A Flash runtime's color correction is document style color correction because
	 * all SWF movies are considered documents with implicit sRGB profiles.
	 * Use the Stage.colorCorrectionSupport property to tell the Flash runtime
	 * to correct colors when displaying the SWF file (document) to the display color space.

	 * (Not available for content running in Flash Player.)StageDisplayState.NORMAL Sets the Flash runtime back to the standard stage display mode.The scaling behavior of the movie in full-screen mode is determined by the scaleMode
	 * setting (set using the Stage.scaleMode property or the SWF file's embed
	 * tag settings in the HTML file). If the scaleMode property is set to noScale
	 * while the application transitions to full-screen mode, the Stage width and height

	 * width and height values and does not dispatch a resize event.The following restrictions apply to SWF files that play within an HTML page (not those using the stand-alone
	 * Flash Player or not running in the AIR runtime):To enable full-screen mode, add the allowFullScreen parameter to the object
	 * and embed tags in the HTML page that includes the SWF file, with allowFullScreen set

	 * An HTML page may also use a script to generate SWF-embedding tags. You need to alter the script
	 * so that it inserts the proper allowFullScreen settings. HTML pages generated by Flash Professional and
	 * Flash Builder use the AC_FL_RunContent() to embed references to SWF files, and you

	 * and Tab keys. Keyboard shortcuts that terminate full-screen mode are: Escape (Windows, Linux, and Mac), Control+W (Windows),
	 * Command+W (Mac), and Alt+F4.
	 * A Flash runtime dialog box appears over the movie when users enter full-screen mode to inform the users they are in
	 * full-screen mode and that they can press the Escape key to end full-screen mode.Starting with Flash Player 9.0.115.0, full-screen works the same in windowless mode as it does in window mode.

	 * but the full-screen window will always be opaque.These restrictions are not present for SWF content running in the
