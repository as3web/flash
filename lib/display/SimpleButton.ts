/**
 * The SimpleButton class lets you control all instances of button symbols in a SWF
 * file.
 *
 *   <p class="- topic/p ">In Flash Professional, you can give a button an instance name in the
 * Property inspector. SimpleButton instance names are displayed in the Movie
 * Explorer and in the Insert Target Path dialog box in the Actions
 * panel. After you create an instance of a button in Flash Professional, you can
 * use the methods and properties of the SimpleButton class to manipulate buttons
 * with ActionScript.</p><p class="- topic/p ">In ActionScript 3.0, you use the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">new SimpleButton()</codeph> constructor to create a
 * SimpleButton instance.</p><p class="- topic/p ">The SimpleButton class inherits from the InteractiveObject class.</p>
 *
 *   EXAMPLE:
 *
 *   The following example uses the SimpleButtonExample class, which in
 * turn uses the CustomSimpleButton class, and this class then instantiates four
 * ButtonDisplayState objects.  The result is a button that is created in the shape of
 * a square, whose background color changes based on the mouse state by overriding instance properties of
 * the SimpleButton class.  This is accomplished by performing the following steps:
 * <ol class="- topic/ol "><li class="- topic/li ">In the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">SimpleButtonExample()</codeph> constructor, a new CustomSimpleButton object of type
 * SimpleButton, called <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">button</codeph>, is created, which calls the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">CustomSimpleButton</codeph> constructor
 * method.  The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">button</codeph> object is the added to the display list.  The button's color and size are
 * determined in the steps that follow.</li><li class="- topic/li ">In the CustomSimpleButton class, instance properties are declared that are later used
 * to control the size and background color of <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">button</codeph>, based on the state it is in (orange
 * in the normal state, dark yellow in the mouse over state, an light blue in the mouse down state).
 * In all of the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">button</codeph>'s states, the size of the square is set to 80 pixels by using the
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">size</codeph> property.</li><li class="- topic/li ">The constructor function for the CustomSimpleButton class sets the
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">downState</codeph>, <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">overState</codeph>, <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">upState</codeph>,
 * <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">hitTestState</codeph>, and <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">useHandCursor</codeph> properties with
 * four instances of the ButtonDisplayState class.</li><li class="- topic/li ">In the ButtonDisplayState class, the constructor sets the value of the
 * square's size and background color and calls the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">draw()</codeph> method.</li><li class="- topic/li ">The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">draw()</codeph> method redraws the square with the size and background color set in
