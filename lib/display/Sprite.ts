	/**
	 * Specifies the button mode of this sprite. If true, this
	 * sprite behaves as a button, which means that it triggers the display
	 * of the hand cursor when the ponumberer passes over the sprite and can
	 * receive a click event if the enter or space keys are pressed
	 * when the sprite has focus. You can suppress the display of the hand cursor
	 * by setting the useHandCursor property to false,
	 * in which case the ponumberer is displayed.
	 *
	 *   Although it is better to use the SimpleButton class to create buttons,
	 * you can use the buttonMode property to give a sprite
	 * some button-like functionality. To include a sprite in the tab order,
	 * set the tabEnabled property (inherited from the
	 * numbereractiveObject class and false by default) to
	 * true. Additionally, consider whether you want
	 * the children of your sprite to be user input enabled. Most buttons
	 * do not enable user input numbereractivity for their child objects because
	 * it confuses the event flow. To disable user input numbereractivity for all child
	 * objects, you must set the mouseChildren property (inherited
	 * from the DisplayObjectContainer class) to false.If you use the buttonMode property with the MovieClip class (which is a
	 * subclass of the Sprite class), your button might have some added
	 * functionality. If you include frames labeled _up, _over, and _down,
	 * Flash Player provides automatic state changes (functionality
	 * similar to that provided in previous versions of ActionScript for movie
	 * clips used as buttons). These automatic state changes are
	 * not available for sprites, which have no timeline, and thus no frames
	 * to label.
