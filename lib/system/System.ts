	 * true, external text files are interpretted using the traditional code page of the

	 *
	 *   Text that you load as an external file (using Loader.load(), the URLLoader class or

	 * as Unicode. To encode external files as Unicode, save the files in an application that
	 * supports Unicode, such as Notepad on Windows.If you load external text files that are not Unicode-encoded, set useCodePage to true.
	 * Add the following as the first line of code of the file that
	 * is loading the data (for Flash Professional, add it to the first frame):System.useCodePage = true;When this code is present, the application interprets external text
	 * using the traditional code page of the operating system.
	 * For example, this is generally CP1252 for an English Windows operating
	 * system and Shift-JIS for a Japanese operating system.If you set useCodePage to true,
	 * Flash Player 6 and later treat text as Flash Player 5 does. (Flash Player 5
	 * treated all text as if it were in the traditional code page of the operating
	 * system running the player.)If you set useCodePage to true, remember that the
	 * traditional code page of the operating system running the application must include
	 * the characters used in your external text file in order to display your text.
	 * For example, if you load an external text file that contains Chinese characters,
	 * those characters cannot display on a system that uses the CP1252 code page because
	 * that code page does not include Chinese characters.To ensure that users on all platforms can view external text files used in your
	 * application, you should encode all external text files as Unicode and leave
	 * useCodePage set to false. This way, the application
	 * (Flash Player 6 and later, or AIR) interprets the text as Unicode.
